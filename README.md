## Description
For this assignment, I created a README generator using node and javascript. I use the fs library and inquirer. I created a set of prompt questions and the user answers them in the terminal and a readme is created.

## Installation

I used Javascript and Node, along with npm install, fs, and inquirer. 

## Usage

This allows users to create a README effectively. You do not have to format becauase the generator formats the README just by the user answering each prompt.

## Credits

All licenses, w3 Schools, and my previous lessons.

## How to Contribute
N/A

## Tests
